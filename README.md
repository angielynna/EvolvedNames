# EvolvedNames
Imagine  a  virtual  world  in  which  all  that  exists  are  strings  of  characters  from  the  following  set,  namely, capital letters, a space, a hyphen, and an apostrophe:  
{ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, ␣, -, ’ }
(The ‘␣’ character stands for a blank space, and is displayed like this merely to be more easily  visible). 
Strings in this world can reproduce new strings and die if they are not fit enough. You will  evolve strings in this world until they spell your name. To do this you will create a Genome class  which will contain a list of characters from the above set representing a string in your world, and  you will create a Population class which will contain a list of Genomes representing all the strings in your world.
